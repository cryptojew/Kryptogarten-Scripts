# Kryptogarten-Scripts
Kryptogarten is a playground for coding, experimenting, learning, and exploring the blockchain technology.

This is the repository to add the scripting tools that will work together with the main functionalities of the Core funcionalities. 

Theoretically, all scripting languages are welcome, as long as they get along with the C code in the Cores. 

All help is great! If you'd like to give a hand, please feel free to branch this repository and submit your pull requests anytime.
